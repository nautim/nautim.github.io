I am interested in studying the structures and dynamics of higher order networks. Among my recent works are studies on percolation on temporal hypergraphs and the rare events of dynamics on hypergraphs.

## Temporal and topological properties of Higher-order networks

Among my recent research, I have delved into the temporal and topological properties of higher-order networks. The intricate dynamics and structure of these networks provide valuable insights into various applications.


## Large deviation theory on hypergraphs

My exploration also includes studies based on the large deviation theory on hypergraphs. Such studies provide an understanding of the rare events and extreme behaviors that can be observed in these complex systems.
