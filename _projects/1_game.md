Here you can find an example of an educational Game that I have designed using Google Forms and Jupyter Notebook. The full version can be accessed in PDF format, and Jupyter Notebook can be accessed [here (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y1ZBtFXtK1dClCo7lVGE4vwp2Hbx_FuI). 

## Game Description

This game is an integral component of a larger Data Challenge Game designed for Bachelor Students who recently started their Data Science journey. Following the lecture on dataset management, students are invited to practice their newfound knowledge by playing this game. Participants emerge in a magical realm, imagining themselves being magicians who want to unlock a mystical chest. However, to do so, they need to resolve some important riddles presented in Jupyter Notebook. Each solve riddle allows students to practice topics such as managing Missing Data, identifying Outliers, handling the Duplicated Values, and so on. By the end of the game, students are expected to complete all tasks and show their grasp of these concepts.

## Game Objectives

Throughout the game, students will:

1. **Identify and handle data anomalies:** Recognize and address missing data, outliers, and duplicated values effectively.

2. **Master dataset management techniques:** Develop proficiency in data cleaning, preprocessing, and manipulation.

3. **Apply recent knowledge:** Transfer concepts learned in dataset management lectures to more practical scenarios.

4. **Troubleshoot data issues independently:** Enhance problem-solving skills in resolving data-related challenges.


## Game-Based Learning

Game-Based Learning is a pedagogical approach that encourages using games to teach and reinforce educational objectives. It is a structured end-to-end approach which immerses learners in a simulated experience, which results in students learning. This concept is closely connected with the idea of Ludic Pedagogy, which embraces the importance of fun, meaningful play, playfulness, and humor WITHOUT sacrificing academic or intellectual rigour.

## Why is it Important?

It is my belief that students should have the opportunity to learn and practice their knowledge in a fun way through immersive gaming experiences. Through Game-Based Learning, students not only deepen their understanding of the subject matter but also cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills.
