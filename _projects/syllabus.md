## Course Description

In the era where Big Data has taken center stage, influencing our daily lives, its application
in Public Policy is still emerging. This course mirrors the current trend by exploring the realm
of applying Data and Network Science for Public Policy objectives, actively contributing to the
surge in popularity and adoption of Data Science methodologies.

Welcome to an engaging and introductory journey! This multidisciplinary course is designed
for CEU undergraduate students keen on discovering the dynamic applications of Data and Network
Science within the realm of Public Policy. Over 12 weeks, the course unfolds in three different
parts. First, students learn or review the fundamentals of Public Policy, Data and Network
Science, and Artificial Intelligence. Next, the spotlight turns to designing and implementing a
Data Science Project tailored to address real-world public policy challenges. Finally, students
explore the variety of applications of Data and Network Science usage cases in different Public
Policy domains, with topics spanning from Health and Education to Energy and Environment
issues.

Upon completing the course, students will design their own Data and Network Science
project, tackling a public policy issue of their choice.

## Course Objectives

The purpose of this course is to:

1. Build Comprehensive Understanding: By the end of the initial weeks, students will identify
and analyse foundational concepts in Public Policy, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence,
establishing a solid groundwork for informed decision-making in public policy through
data-driven insights.

2. Apply Data Science Techniques: Students will apply their knowledge to design and implement
a Data Science Project addressing real-world public policy challenges, evaluating
project outcomes critically and completing the implementation within a specified timeframe.

3. Explore Diverse Applications: Throughout the course, students will identify and analyse
patterns in various Data and Network Science applications across public policy domains,
evaluating and judging the effectiveness of these applications through case studies.
