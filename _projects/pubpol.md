## About this Project

During my Master of Public Administration at Central European University (CEU) in Vienna, I conducted policy-oriented research aimed at proposing viable policy solutions to diverse challenges for stakeholders and policymakers. One of the most significant projects was my year-long Applied Policy Project for the International Institute for Sustainable Development, where my team and I focused on "Energy Transition Pathways for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)." This investigation involved conducting case studies on the business models of oil and gas companies in India, Denmark, the UK, and China, designing and executing an expert survey with 40 participants, conducting expert interviews with 10 participants, and preparing a comprehensive policy report with recommendations for Indian energy SOEs and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Additionally, my Master's Thesis titled "Testing During the COVID Pandemic: How Government Policies Changed Our Behavior" focused on the impact evaluation of different testing policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.
