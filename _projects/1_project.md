I have been deeply involved in the analysis of higher-order brain networks to study various problems. These analyses provide a unique perspective on the intricate connections and dynamics of brain networks, enabling deeper insights into various neurological conditions and the overall functioning of the brain.

## Higher-order metrics for epilepsy

In our recent work, we have turned our focus towards epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disorder. We propose the use of higher-order measures of centrality to effectively identify epileptogenic zones. These measures offer a nuanced understanding of the focal points of epileptic activity, providing invaluable information for both research and clinical applications.

## Structural brain networks and higher-order hubs

Our research extends to studying structural brain networks, emphasizing the characterization of higher-order hubs. These hubs play a critical role in the overall connectivity and functioning of the brain, and their detailed analysis can shed light on various aspects of neural health, cognition, and disease states.
