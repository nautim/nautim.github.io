## About this Project

During my Bachelor's degree in Political Science, I participated in various research projects focusing on analysing electoral processes and state institutions in Russia, as well as investigating patronal linkages within the Russian elite.

From October 2018 to June 2019, I worked on the project "Patronal Networks in Modern Russia" led by Nikolai Petrov, and wrote literature reviews, conducted content analysis of media, created a research database, and prepared a report for an international conference.

In the project "Presidential Elections in Russia and Abroad: Comparative Analysis" from October 2017 to June 2018, led by Rostislav Turovsky, I conducted an electoral analysis of the presidential elections in France (2017) and Russia (2018).

From October 2016 to June 2018, I contributed to the "Image of the Politician in Russia" project led by the Laboratory for Political Studies at NRU HSE, where I searched and systematised data about Russian politicians, prepared an interview questionnaire, and interviewed four deputies of the State Duma of Russia.

My Bachelor's thesis, supervised by Dina Rosenberg, examined e-government policies and was titled "The Relationship between E-Government and the Quality of Public Goods Provision and Government Effectiveness."
