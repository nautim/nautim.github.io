We have worked on detecting patterns in human behaviors, diving deep into the intricate nuances of social interactions and their dynamic nature.

## Temporal patterns of human communication

We have studied the temporal characteristics and delved into the aspect of reciprocity across various communication datasets. This analysis provides an understanding of how and when humans communicate, unraveling the patterns that define our social connectivities.

## Group formation in collaboration datasets

By performing a higher-order analysis, we have critically examined how patterns and formations in scientific collaborations have evolved over time. This exploration was based on an extensive coauthorship dataset, providing insights into the ever-evolving nature of scientific networking and cooperation.
