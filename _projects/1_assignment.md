Here is an example of a final assignment for the course "Data and Network Science for Public Policy." I designed this assignment with a focus on modern teaching methodologies, particularly Project-Based Learning, aimed at enhancing students' abilities to design and execute applied data science projects with a tangible final product. 


## About this Assignment

This assignment allows students in small groups to design and implement their own data science project aimed at addressing significant societal challenges. Consequently, students collaborate to produce a collective final presentation and individual policy papers.


## Project-Based Learning

Project-Based Learning is a pedagogical approach in which students gain knowledge and skills by investigating and responding to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge. Students showcase their knowledge and skills by creating a public product or presentation for a real audience.


## Why is it Important?

It is my strong belief that students should be able to apply their learning in real-world scenarios, allowing them to develop practical skills that are essential in today's world. By engaging in Project-Based Learning, students not only deepen their understanding of the subject matter but also cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills. Moreover, it also provides a great opportunity to start building their data science portfolio.
