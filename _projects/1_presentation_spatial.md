Here you can find an example of a presentation I crafted for the Spatial Data Mining class, which I taught as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Mining and Big Data Analytics course

## Class Description

In this class, I introduce different concepts of spatial and geospatial data mining to the students. It covers topics such as Spatial Data Mining and its Applications, Spatial Autocorrelation and Clustering, Point Pattern Analysis, and Trajectory Mining.

## Why is it Important?

Through this instructional material, my goal is to demonstrate my dedication to crafting presentations and organising lessons in a way that ensures they are not only comprehensive but also easily understandable for students of varying backgrounds and levels of expertise.
