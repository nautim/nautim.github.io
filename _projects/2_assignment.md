Here is an example of Experiential Hackathon Assignment I designed with a focus on Experiential Learning, aimed not only at enhancing students' abilities to design and execute applied data science projects but also at reflecting critically on their experience of working with a non-private client for social good. 


## About this Assignment

This assignment allows students to participate in a sustainable development Data Hackathon supervised by civil society organisations in Vienna.


## Project-Based Learning

Project-Based Learning is a pedagogical approach in which students gain knowledge and skills by investigating and responding to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge. Students showcase their knowledge and skills by creating a public product or presentation for a real audience.


## Why is it Important?

It is my strong belief that students should be able to apply their learning in real-world scenarios, allowing them to develop practical skills that are essential in today's world. By engaging in Project-Based Learning, students not only deepen their understanding of the subject matter but also cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills. Moreover, it also provides a great opportunity to start building their data science portfolio.
