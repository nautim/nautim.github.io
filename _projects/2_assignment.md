Here is an example of an Experiential Hackathon Assignment I've designed with a focus on Experiential Learning, aimed not only at enhancing students' abilities to design and execute applied data science projects but also at critically reflecting on their experience of working with non-private clients for social good.


## About this Assignment

This assignment allows students to participate in a sustainable development Data Hackathon supervised by civil society organisations in Vienna. By working closely with these organisations, students will not only gain valuable practical experience but also contribute meaningfully to initiatives aimed at promoting social good in the local community. 


## Experiential Learning

Experiential Learning is a pedagogical approach in which students gain knowledge and skills by focusing on the process rather than outcomes. The entire learning process is grounded in experience. Moreover, this approach invites students to understand themselves as learners and empowers them to take charge of their learning.

## Why is it Important?

I strongly believe students should have more chances to engage in Experiential Learning, where they can immerse themselves in practical experiences of working together with an organisation. Moreover, it provides students with a platform to contribute to social good, as they work to address pressing societal challenges.
