I am a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Network and Data Science](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/) @ [CEU](https://www.ceu.edu/) under the supervision of [Márton Karsai](https://www.martonkarsai.com/) and [Elisa Omodei](https://elisaomodei.weebly.com/). 

Beyond my official position, I identify as a social data scientist (or computational social scientist) passionate about understanding human behaviour and inequalities, and their intersections with international development and Sustainable Development Goals.
