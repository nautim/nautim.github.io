Students showcase their knowledge and skills by creating a public product or presentation for a real audience.</p> <h2 id="why-is-it-important">Why is it Important?</h2> <p>It is my strong belief that students should be able to apply their learning in real-world scenarios, allowing them to develop practical skills that are essential in today’s world. By engaging in Project-Based Learning, students not only deepen their understanding of the subject matter but also cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills. Moreover, it also provides a great opportunity to start building their data science portfolio.</p> </body></html>
